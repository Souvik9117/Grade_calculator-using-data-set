Tools Used in Student Marks Analysis Project:

1. pandas – For data loading, manipulation, and analysis.
2. matplotlib.pyplot – For data visualization (bar chart, histogram, pie chart).
3. Python built-in functions – For logic, conditions, and calculations.
4. CSV file handling – For input (students_marks.csv) and output (students_report.csv).

Description:
This project reads student marks from a CSV file, calculates totals, percentages, and grades,
and then visualizes the data using different charts.
